## About DN42 Experimental Network

 DN42, aka Decentralized Network 42, is a large, decentralized VPN-based network. But unlike other traditional VPNs, DN42 itself doesn't provide any VPN exits, which means it doesn't allow you to bypass Internet censorships or unlock streaming services. On the contrary, the goal of DN42 is to simulate another Internet. It uses much of the technology running on modern Internet backbones (BGP, recursive DNS, etc), and is a great replica of a real network environment.
